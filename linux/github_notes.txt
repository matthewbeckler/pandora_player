The fork of pianobar is under matthewbeckler/pianobar. Install git, and then do this to get started:

git clone git@github.com:matthewbeckler/pianobar.git

Then do this to connect it to the upstream repository:

cd pianobar
git remote add upstream git://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar.git
git fetch upstream

To push changes back to your fork on github:
git push origin master

(Now you can send a pull request to upstream via the website.)

To re-sync with upstream:
git fetch upstream
